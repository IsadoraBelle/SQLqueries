A CTE I did to find the top customer count

WITH top_customer_count_cte (country, all_customer_count,
top_customer_count) AS
(SELECT DISTINCT (a.country),
COUNT (DISTINCT D.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT (DISTINCT a.country) AS top_customer_count
FROM country A
INNER JOIN city B ON a.country_id = b.country_id
INNER JOIN address C ON b.city_id = c.city_id
INNER JOIN customer D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
LEFT JOIN (SELECT B.customer_id,
B.first_name,
B.last_name,
e.country,
d.city,
SUM (A.amount) AS total_paid
FROM customer B
INNER JOIN payment A ON B.customer_id = A.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON c.city_id = d.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON d.country_id = e.country_ID
WHERE d.city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni',
'Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang',
'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY B.customer_id,B.first_name,B.last_name,d.city,e.country
ORDER BY total_paid DESC
LIMIT 5) AS top_5_customers
ON a.country=top_5_customers.COUNTRY
GROUP BY a.country, top_5_customers
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT * FROM top_customer_count_cte;
